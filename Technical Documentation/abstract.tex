\begin{abstract}
This paper outlines an algorithm an virtual studio technology plug-in for emulating the effect of a stereophonic recording array on a monophonically recorded sound source. This emulation will localize the sound within the perceptual soundstage using the time-domain and level-domain cues appropriate to the microphone array specifications chosen by the user. The document covers the theoretical basis for the algorithm, as well as the design decisions made during the specific implementation.

The audio plug-in specified in this document was designed as an entry to the 2020 AES/MATLAB plug-in design competition.
