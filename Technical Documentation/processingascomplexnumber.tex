The transfer function that a virtual microphone applies to the signal is applied in the time and amplitude domains. The function of a microphone on a signal, can be considered in the form:

\begin{equation}
	m(S) = \Delta{}v + \Delta{}t
\end{equation}

Where $\Delta v$ is the change in amplitude, and $\Delta t$ is the change in time.
