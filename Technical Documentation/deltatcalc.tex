The $\Delta{}t$ component represents the time that it takes for the sound emitted by source $S$ to reach the position of virtual microphone $m$. Following from (\ref{distance}), the value of $d_{\vec{mS}}$ when combined with the speed of sound constant $c$ can be used to find the time-domain component.

\subsubsection{Calculating the speed of sound}

The speed of sound in real spaces is generally considered to be ~\SI[per-mode=fraction]{343}{\m\per\s}.
