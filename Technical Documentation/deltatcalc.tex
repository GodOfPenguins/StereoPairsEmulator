The $\Delta{}t$ component represents the time that it takes for the sound emitted by source $S$ to reach the position of virtual microphone $m$. Following from (\ref{distance}), the value of $d_{\vec{mS}}$ when combined with the speed of sound constant $c$ can be used to find the time-domain component.

\subsubsection{Calculating the speed of sound}

The speed of sound in real spaces is generally considered to be ~\SI[per-mode=fraction]{343}{\m\per\s}. However, it is not a constant. The speed of sound can change based on a number of environmental parameters. To account for this, the speed of sound can be adjusted by some value, $\Delta{}c$, which is implemented in this version as a number $\Delta{}c = [-10, 10]$; so that:

\begin{equation}\label{speedofsound}
c = 343 + \Delta{}c
\end{equation}

Following the usual formula for time:

\begin{equation}\label{timeFormula}
t = \frac{d}{c}
\end{equation}

Substitutions can be made based on (\ref{distance}) and (\ref{speedofsound}) to give the expansion of $\Delta{}t$:

\begin{equation}\label{deltat}
\Delta{}t = \frac{d_{\vec{v}}}{343 + \Delta{}c}
\end{equation}
