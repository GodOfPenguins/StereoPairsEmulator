\subsection{The Sound Source}

\subsubsection{The propogation of sound from real sound sources}

The first immidiate barrier to modeling the propogation of sound from a sound source is the nature of any given sound source. Few acoustic resonators approach being perfect point sources with equal spherical radation of sound accross the entire audible frequency spectrum.
